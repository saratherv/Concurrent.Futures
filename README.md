# Concurrent.Futures
- The concurrent.futures module provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables.The asynchronous execution can be performed with threads, using ThreadPoolExecutor, or separate processes, using     ProcessPoolExecutor. Both implement the same interface, which is defined by the abstract Executor class.

- Here, I used this library to extract data from the given URL and calculate size of it. It is executed as multi-threads as well as multi-processes.
